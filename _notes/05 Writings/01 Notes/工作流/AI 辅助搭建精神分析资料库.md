我目前正在使用 AI 工具构建一个精神分析资料库，这是我很早之前就考虑过的一个概念。之前，我手动创建了一个文献数据库，主要包含文献，特别是 PEP 相关的文献。然而，我一直想要包括更多内容，比如视频、播客或文章。

当时的主要问题是有限的时间和精力。虽然我经常听和看内容，但我发现将大量精力投入到总结和创建完整数据库中是有挑战的。从我的核心需求和目标来看，这部分内容更多是用来拓宽视野，了解大家正在讨论什么，而不是满足我核心的理论和技术需求。

借助 AI 工具，这个过程变得非常方便。现在，我可以每天花几分钟整理一两个视频或博客。这也符合我之前在数字花园中组织内容的打算。然而，我决定不在花园中包含这些内容，因为它可能会干扰我个人创作的独创性。花园目前只展示我的原创作品，而摘要内容则保存在数据库中。将来，我计划将数据库打造成一个订阅服务。

I am currently using AI tools to construct a psychoanalysis database, a concept I had considered a long time ago. Previously, I manually created a database that primarily consisted of literature, especially literature related to PEP. However, I always wanted to include more content such as videos, podcasts, or articles.

The main challenge at that time was limited energy and time. While I did listen to and watch content regularly, I found it challenging to invest substantial effort into summarizing and creating a complete database. The return on investment in terms of my core needs and goals was not very high. This content was more for broadening my perspective and keeping up with discussions rather than addressing my core theoretical and technical needs.

With the help of AI tools, the process has become much more convenient. Now, I can spend a few minutes each day organizing a couple of videos or blogs. This effort aligns with my previous intention to organize content in the Digital Garden. However, I decided not to include this content in the garden, as it might disrupt the originality of my personal creations. The garden currently showcases only my original work, while the summarized content from other sources is kept in the database. In the future, I plan to turn the database into a subscription-based service.
