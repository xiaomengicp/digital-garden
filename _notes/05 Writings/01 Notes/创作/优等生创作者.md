我认为[[优等生创作者]]这个概念非常吸引人，因为他们似乎将创作过程也逻辑化了。他们可能首先会构建自己的数据库，然后追求一种创作的工具流方法论，仿佛创作可以被分解成一种工业逻辑来执行。这让我想起了[[安德烈·格林]]所说的"[[过渡空间]]没有成为一个过渡空间"，即艺术创作不再是一个过渡的空间。
回想起[[陈哲艺]]，他的老婆是金融从业者，这种反差相当明显。此外，他之前影片中所描述的"工整准确"和他对"控制狂"的描述，虽然有些相似，但在本质上，他们仍然需要进行创作，他们想要突破，但即使是突破，也不能完全是意义上的颠覆。

## 英文草稿

### Introduction

I first encountered the concept of '优等生创作者' (which can be translated as "Outstanding Student Creators") during an interview with Chen Zheyi, a Chinese film director based in Singapore. This concept succinctly encapsulated a vague feeling I had been harboring, inspiring me to embark on this essay. 
加一句
While it may not be widely recognized on a global scale, I firmly believe it holds significant relevance within the Chinese context.

In this essay, I aim to explore the ambivalence experienced by creators who must navigate a unique and less conventional path as artists, all while adhering to societal norms in mainstream society to secure financial stability and power as a means of shielding themselves from narcissistic vulnerability. I also intend to discuss whether, in this complex situation, artworks can still serve as a transitional space, facilitating mental development, or if they inadvertently trap individuals in an attention-seeking phase, leading to the formation of a false self.

Specifically, I intend to explore this phenomenon by delving into the experiences of Chen Zheyi and Chen Xinghan. Chen Zheyi, a renowned figure in the film industry, and Chen Xinghan, an independent Chinese game developer operating in the United States, both offer valuable insights into the intricacies of this phenomenon.

### Chinese context of "Outstanding Student Creators"

The concept "Outstanding Student Creators" is undeniably paradoxical. Being a creator entails innovation, breaking established norms, and defying societal conventions. On the other hand, an outstanding student typically adheres to existing systems, follows traditional rules, and excels at conforming to the status quo. This inherent contradiction is striking. 

However, I can comprehend its relevance in the Chinese context.

Being a good student itself holds immense significance in China, and this is deeply rooted in Chinese history and its political system. Historically, obtaining high marks and succeeding in the national examinations was the primary path to becoming an official in the country. This, in turn, granted individuals power, fame, and wealth. This tradition persists today, exemplified by the continued importance of the national university entrance examination (gaokao).

In light of this historical context, there are several well-known sayings that underscore the value of being a diligent student:

1. "学而优则仕" (xué ér yōu zé shì): This phrase translates to "Studying diligently to become an official." It emphasizes the link between academic excellence and attaining positions of authority.

2. "天子重英豪" (tiān zǐ zhòng yīng háo): Translated, it means "The emperor values talents and heroes." This saying highlights the appreciation for individuals with exceptional abilities and achievements.

3. "书中自有黄金屋" (shū zhōng zì yǒu huáng jīn wū): This phrase can be translated as "Within books, there are rooms filled with gold." It underscores the idea that knowledge and education hold the key to prosperity and success.

We even have stories like '范进中举' (Fàn Jìn Zhòng Jǔ) to illustrate this cultural emphasis. In this tale, an old man named 范进 (Fàn Jìn) achieves success by passing the imperial examination (中举, Zhòng Jǔ), a significant accomplishment in ancient China's meritocratic system, but tragically descends into psychosis in the aftermath of his success.

Absolutely, the pressure for academic success in China continues to have significant consequences, and this includes schools like 黄冈中学 (Huánggāng Zhōngxué) that are known for their strict, military-style training and high rates of students advancing to higher levels of education. This intense focus on achieving top marks can indeed result in various mental health challenges for teenagers.

In light of our previous discussion, it becomes clearer that in Chinese culture, being an outstanding student is highly esteemed, even for those aspiring to become creators. Remarkably, one could argue that for creators, especially, excelling academically is a coveted objective. This paradoxical situation arises because within the Chinese context, venturing onto a creative path can be perceived as risky, rebellious, and a departure from the established route. Consequently, Chinese creators often feel compelled to uphold their status as outstanding students to provide assurance to their parents and families. It's essential to recognize that Chinese culture places a strong emphasis on collectivism, and this facet introduces an additional layer of complexity to this phenomenon.

### Chen Zheyi and Chen Xinghan

Undoubtedly, we can observe this situation in both of the creators, Chen Zheyi and Chen Xinghan. Chen Zheyi graduated from one of the best film-making institutes in the UK, while Chen Xinghan pursued education at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and USC, both renowned institutions in game development. Even as they embark on creative endeavors, the expectation remains to do so with precision, adhering to the highest standards, and thereby earning recognition.

Chen Xinghan is well-known for his zen-like games, which are deeply meditative and peaceful.  In one of Chen Xinghan's interviews, however, he clarified that his motivation for creating these games was not solely out of personal preference but driven by a desire to excel. The competitive spirit, a significant part of the Asian culture, still remains a driving force behind his work.

Chen Zheyi's story bears a striking similarity because he has consistently been an exemplary student, and his family has held exceptionally high expectations for him. Even though his parents are supportive of his choice to become a film director, he feels compelled to excel and demonstrate the correctness of his decision. He dedicates himself tirelessly to his craft, creating eight short films before embarking on his very first full-length movie. This early work displayed a maturity and uniqueness that belied his age and experience.
### Being a Creator

The urge to pursue a unique and unconventional path as a creator is, at its core, a quest for visibility. Some might even argue that it embodies an all-encompassing fantasy — to truly stand out and occupy an extraordinarily special place within one's mother's heart.

Moreover, the act of creation, of making art, serves as a means to process one's own trauma and make sense of personal experiences, especially when those experiences are complex and challenging. It provides a transitional space, a refuge from the harsh realities of life, and a sanctuary for concealment.

Creating is a means to master one's solitude rather than succumb to it. It establishes a realm where self-command prevails, a domain where one can wield authority and play the role of their own god, rather than feeling helpless and desperate in a chaotic world that often lies beyond one's control, rendering them vulnerable.

Nonetheless, when one opts for a career as a creator, the harsh realities of life have a tendency to encroach upon the fantasy and transitional space. Sustaining the positive emotions we discussed earlier can become quite challenging.

Even just commencing the creative process can be fraught with narcissistic wounds. Initially, one may hold a belief in their innate talent, only to be confronted by the stark reality that projects take time to complete and skills require development. This fluctuation between feelings of omnipotence narcissism and narcissistic wounds is a challenging aspect of the creative journey.

Furthermore, the path to becoming a creator is far from easy. In reality, it involves a complex array of project management, career planning, human resources, and more. The process itself is often messy, chaotic, and challenging to navigate, occasionally bordering on the traumatic. Failures along the way can easily lead to self-blame, with individuals questioning their own talent and abilities.

### Being a Outstanding Student

金榜题名

In Chinese culture, the term "outstanding student" refers to a specific type of student who excels within the system, showcasing not only exceptional academic performance but also a strong adherence to authority. This characteristic is highly esteemed in the Chinese context, and various terms like obedient (听话), well-behaved, filial (孝顺), among others, are used to commend these qualities.

Thus, being labeled as an outstanding student is more than just a 'good' title; it actually evokes quite complex emotions. Often, it suggests not genuine talent but merely the ability to navigate a rigid system, thereby potentially facing challenges once outside the system. In contemporary terms, it may even signify a typical family background, leaving no alternative path for success other than to remain highly competitive without genuinely enhancing one's capabilities. Phrases like '小镇做题家' (small-town problem-solving expert) and '内卷' describe these phenomena. 

On the other side of the concept of an outstanding student, it can evoke feelings of shame or humiliation, as if one doesn't truly know oneself or possess any real talent or capability, yet is unable to change or explore an alternative path. Being within the system may feel safe and familiar, yet simultaneously confining. It is secure but monotonous, and not necessarily the optimal choice to be a good student. Once someone has other opportunities, they might opt for different paths instead of strictly adhering to the rules to excel academically.

This is partly the reality in China, with its less flexible education system, increasing class disparities, and recent economic slowdown. The fairness that the university entrance exam aims to bring, while considered one of the best options within this context, also constrains the free development of students. The singular evaluation system fails to fully recognize individual specialties within a vast population.

However, it is also a systemic production of a false self in a very uniform manner. Zheng Yuanjie, a fairy tale writer in China, once penned a story in which every student is required to be a rabbit as part of their education, embodying the metaphor of being obedient. This concept is deeply intertwined with and rooted in Asian collective culture and its political system.

This situation raises a problem: What is the cost of daring to be free, of embracing one's true self, or, as psychoanalysis might interpret it metaphorically, of 'killing the father' without succumbing to excessive guilt or experiencing abandonment? I believe the concept of the outstanding student creator directly corresponds to this dilemma faced by some Chinese individuals.

To some degree, these outstanding student creators are also privileged; one has to admit that they have the ability to choose an alternative road, and this, in itself, is evidence of their privilege. However, even for them, it is challenging to entirely break free from the system. If they were to do so, they might find themselves figuratively homeless.

In Chinese, there's even a specific term, not a strictly scientific one but more akin to popular psychology, called '好学生综合症' (Hǎoxuéshēng Zònghézhèng), which can be translated as 'Overachiever Syndrome'.

How can we comprehend being an outstanding student, particularly in a Chinese context? Essentially, it may be a means of survival in an environment with limited resources. In this context, one must recognize patterns and discover corresponding solutions to become fully prepared to attain power and emerge as a victor. Nevertheless, even if one achieves victory, it often comes at the cost of love, affection, or genuine connections because it adheres to a 'social Darwinism' that objectifies both oneself and others.

It might not be challenging to understand why these outstanding student creators often rely heavily on so-called methodologies. Undoubtedly, these methodologies provide them with a sense of mastery and control, even if it contrasts somewhat with the act of pure creativity. Taking Chen Xinghan and Chen Zheyi as examples, they not only attended renowned institutes and universities to study advanced techniques in filmmaking and game development, but Chen Xinghan also completed his master's thesis entitled 'The Flow of ,' proposing a model for dynamic difficulty design, which is essentially a methodology and foundational framework for game design itself. It's evident that this methodology was at the forefront of his thinking from the very beginning.

This ambivalent existence is, in fact, the only means through which one can maintain their individuality while coexisting with a society that often provides very limited space for personal expression.

In fact, this is why when you attempt to seek a method of reading or writing, you have already deviated from the essence of 'existence' itself. You might believe that you can control and manipulate this process, but in reality, creativity is a spontaneous, experiential process. Thus, in the pursuit of a particular method of creation, even though you may produce outstanding and exquisite works, you are likely to have forfeited the space for the transitional phase. This is the paradox faced by many exceptional creators.

This paradox bears some resemblance to Winnicott's concepts but seems to be inverted here. I believe it may even be a source of unhappiness for many successful individuals in East Asia. While they may appear highly accomplished and exceptional to the outside world, in their quest for perfection and control over the creative process, they may have lost the spontaneity, freedom, and joy of creative spirit.
### transitional space

André Green posits the view that many artists do not consider their work as a transitional space, which could hinder their mental development and maturity. This is akin to the situation of borderline patients who struggle to dream or utilize dreams as a transitional space. However, I believe this perspective does not precisely apply to Chen Zheyi and Chen Xinghan.

The works of Chen Zheyi and Chen Xinghan are both robust and thought-provoking. They delve into crucial areas of human experience. For instance, Chen Zheyi's films primarily explore relationships that are challenging to define and deviate from social norms, yet encapsulate a pure essence of connection. Similarly, Chen Xinghan crafts beautiful emotional experiences through collaboration in his games, notably in 'Journey.' As award-winning creators, it is challenging to argue that their work does not serve as a transitional space.

However, I do believe that there are factors that hinder their ability to fully utilize the transitional space, thus creating a paradox. This is particularly evident in the realms of movies and indie games, where the creative process often resembles a product within an industrialized workflow rather than a more spontaneous, personal expression. It's intriguing that they've chosen these specific forms of art over more spontaneous ones. They've also achieved a certain degree of commercial success. To be commercially successful requires finding a delicate balance between self-expression and meeting the demands of a broad audience.

It may not be an ideal situation, but I believe it represents the best compromise they can find to strike a balance between preserving a part of oneself and adhering to societal norms for safety. In such a scenario, sacrifices are inevitable to secure a larger degree of personal freedom, particularly within a society that may not be inherently free. It might even be considered 'healthy,' as psychoanalysis often emphasizes 'adaptation' without compromising one's identity, showcasing a well-functioning ego.

### Paradoxical Language

Winnicott also extensively employs paradoxical language. In _[Basic Fault](app://obsidian.md/Basic%20Fault)_, [Balint](app://obsidian.md/Balint) astutely highlights that the production of paradoxical languages originates from the limitations of adult languages, serving as a resolution to the Oedipal complex. However, in an early phase, such as the area of creation (similar to transitional space) and basic fault, it predates the Oedipal stage. It involves only two persons instead of three and is much more primitive. Consequently, adult language proves inadequate and even inappropriate for use in these contexts, compelling the invention of new ways of expression, leading to the development of paradoxical language.
