显然，这个在线社群也是疫情期间的产物。而疫情也带来了我们交流方式的很多变化，线上交流似乎已经成为了必不可少的部分。如同[[疫情带来许多线上精神分析变化]]一样。显然，它与亲自在场是不同的，但我所讨论的这个在线社群试图以一种拟物化的方式营造和还原亲自在场的氛围。

比如，一个在线咖啡馆的设计，由城市规划设计师的像素艺术创作而成，看起来就像一个在线咖啡馆，只是以图画的形式存在。因此，它与通常的在线会议有很大的不同。每个人都有一个自己的虚拟身份，可以在空间中移动，就像在虚拟游戏中一样。如果靠近某个人，就可以在这个在线空间中拍拍他们的肩膀，而要听到彼此说话，他们必须靠近到一定程度，否则就要连接公共麦克风才能说话。他们还可以进入在线咖啡馆的不同房间，这些房间是相隔离的，你不能听到另一个房间的人说话。因此，这是一个既公共又私密的咖啡馆，就像实体咖啡馆一样。

它有点类似于设计趋势中的拟物设计，因此尽管在某种程度上，它比视频会议更加不在场，因为你可以选择不同的状态，可以选择关闭或打开麦克风或摄像头，但在这个空间中，大多数人通常选择关闭摄像头，而不是打开摄像头。这反而具有一种非侵入性。它尊重这样一个事实，因为我们现在处于不同的地理位置，我们不会互相侵入。因此，即使你在电脑的另一端，可能穿着睡衣或正在做饭，实际上都没有关系，这并不影响你真正参与到讨论中。同时，这样的设计可以让你真正感受到另一个人的存在，是一种在场但不侵入的感觉。这与温尼科特的独处能力有很大联系，因为独处的能力本身也是在另一个人在场的情况下发展起来的。而在疫情中，每个人都被隔离，迫切需要与另一个人接触，但面对面的接触变得有些侵入，会引发一些偏执状态的反应，所以在这种情况下，陪伴而不侵入就成了一个重要的特点。

关于这一点，线上社群还有一些设计，比如在线自习室。比如在会议开始时，我们有15分钟的静默时间，可以写自己的工作日志。在不侵入的情况下，它能够保持创作力。因为如果我们把所有的时间都用在交谈和互动上，我们就没有时间面对自己的内心，进行创作。但如果没有另一个人在场，启动这样的过程会变得非常困难。但如果我们过于投入到活动中，就没有时间去面对内心，去挖掘自己内心的宝藏，从而失去了创造力。

Clearly, this online community is also a product of the pandemic. The pandemic has brought about many changes in how we communicate, and online communication seems to have become an indispensable part of it, as discussed in [[疫情带来许多线上精神分析变化|Changes in Online Psychoanalysis During the Pandemic]]. Obviously, it is different from being physically present, but the online community I am discussing here is trying to create and recreate the atmosphere of being physically present in a mimetic way.

For example, the design of an online café, created by a pixel artist who is also a urban planning designer, looks like an online café but exists in the form of drawings. Therefore, it is significantly different from typical online meetings. Each person has their virtual avatar and can move in space, similar to a virtual game. If you get close to someone, you can pat them on the shoulder in this online space, and to hear each other speak, they must get close to a certain extent, or else connect to a public microphone. They can also enter different rooms in the online café, and these rooms are isolated, so you can't hear people in another room. Hence, it's both a public and private café, just like a physical café.

It's somewhat similar to the design trend of mimetic design. Therefore, although to some extent, it is more absent than video conferences because you can choose different states, such as turning off or turning on the microphone or camera, most people usually choose to turn off the camera rather than turn it on. This actually has a non-intrusive quality. It respects the fact that we are now in different geographical locations, and we do not invade each other. So, even if you're on the other end of the computer, perhaps in pajamas or cooking, it doesn't really matter. This doesn't affect your actual participation in the discussion. At the same time, this design allows you to truly feel the presence of another person, creating a sense of being present but not intrusive. This is closely related to Winnicott's capacity to be alone because the ability to be alone developed in the presence of another person. In the pandemic, where everyone is isolated and there is an urgent need for contact with another person, face-to-face contact has become somewhat intrusive and can trigger paranoid reactions. In this situation, being present without being intrusive has become an important feature.

Regarding this, online communities also have some designs, such as online study rooms. For example, at the beginning of the meeting, we have 15 minutes of silence to write our own work logs. In a non-intrusive situation, it can maintain creativity. Because if we spend all our time talking and interacting, we won't have time to face our inner selves and engage in creative work. However, if there is no one else present, starting such a process becomes very difficult. But if we are too immersed in activities, we won't have time to face our inner selves and explore the treasures within, resulting in a loss of creativity.
